# Unconsolidated Code
This directory contains code that is not yet a part of the NearestNeighbors package.

> [!CAUTION]
> As a matter of practice, all code in this directory should be treated as potentially buggy. Before taking ownership of and productionizing any of the code here within the NearestNeighbors package, please ensure that you have tested it thoroughly and sought feedback & approval from the team.

### Inventory
- ~~Tathagatha's R code for synthetic data generation as well as for TSNN, in the `synthetic_data_and_TSNN_R` directory~~
- ~~A first attempt at Python translation in `synthetic_data_fns.py`. (Once the data-loading code is in `main`, this will be added as part of the same interface)~~
- A link to Syn-NN code, below.
